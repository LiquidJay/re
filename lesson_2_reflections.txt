What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?


git adds meta
keep track of things'



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

files edited and ready to commit 



when writing a git message.... write it as a command
eg  "add a new styl"   instead of "added a new style"



git diff  'working directory'  'staging area'
git diff --staged  'staging area'   'commit' 


git log --graph --oneline master coins

git show  [commit]        "shows commit against parent"
